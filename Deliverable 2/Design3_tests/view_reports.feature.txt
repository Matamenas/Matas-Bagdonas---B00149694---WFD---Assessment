Feature: View Inventory Reports
  As any authorized user
  I want to view item usage and stock reports
  So I can track inventory trends

  Scenario: Generate a usage report
    Given I am logged in
    When I go to the Reports section
    And I filter by "Lab Equipment"
    Then I should see a report of all Lab Equipment usage

  Scenario: Export report to PDF
    Given a report is visible on screen
    When I click "Export to PDF"
    Then a PDF version should be downloaded
