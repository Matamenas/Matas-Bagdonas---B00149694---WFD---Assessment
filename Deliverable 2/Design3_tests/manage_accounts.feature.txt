Feature: Manage User Accounts
  As a System Administrator
  I want to create, update, and deactivate user accounts
  So that only authorized users can access the system

  Scenario: Add a new user account
    Given I am logged in as a System Administrator
    When I add a user with username "jane.doe", role "Teacher", and email "jane@example.com"
    Then the new user "jane.doe" should appear in the user list

  Scenario: Update an existing user role
    Given a user "john.manager" exists with role "Teacher"
    When I change their role to "Inventory Manager"
    Then the user "john.manager" should have role "Inventory Manager"

  Scenario: Deactivate a user account
    Given a user "mark.admin" exists
    When I deactivate "mark.admin"
    Then "mark.admin" should no longer be able to log in
