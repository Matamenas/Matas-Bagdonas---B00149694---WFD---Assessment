Feature: Manage Database
  As a System Administrator
  I want to back up and restore the database
  So that data is safe and recoverable in case of issues

  Scenario: Perform a database backup
    Given I am logged in as a System Administrator
    When I click on "Backup Database"
    Then a backup file should be generated and downloaded

  Scenario: Restore the database from a backup
    Given I have a valid database backup file
    When I upload the backup and confirm restoration
    Then the system should restore data from the backup

  Scenario: View system logs
    Given I am logged in as a System Administrator
    When I navigate to "System Logs"
    Then I should see a list of recent system activities
