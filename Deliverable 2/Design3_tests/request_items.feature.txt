Feature: Request Items
  As a Teacher
  I want to request items from inventory
  So that I can use them in my class

  Scenario: Submit an item request
    Given I am logged in as a Teacher
    And an item "Microscope" exists in the system
    When I request 2 "Microscopes" for "Classroom experiment"
    Then my request should be submitted for approval

  Scenario: View my past requests
    Given I have submitted a request for "Markers"
    When I view "My Requests"
    Then I should see a record of the "Markers" request
