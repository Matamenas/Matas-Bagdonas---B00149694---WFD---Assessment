Feature: Manage Categories
  As an Inventory Manager
  I want to organize items into categories
  So that inventory is easier to manage

  Scenario: Add a new category
    Given I am logged in as an Inventory Manager
    When I create a category "Science Lab"
    Then "Science Lab" should appear in the category list

  Scenario: Delete a category
    Given the category "Obsolete Equipment" exists
    When I delete "Obsolete Equipment"
    Then it should no longer appear in the category list
