Feature: Create Purchase Orders
  As a Procurement Officer
  I want to restock inventory when items are low
  So that teachers always have needed resources

  Scenario: Create a new purchase order
    Given I am logged in as a Procurement Officer
    And "Microscopes" are low in stock
    When I create a purchase order for 20 "Microscopes"
    Then the purchase order should be saved and marked "Pending"

  Scenario: Receive items from a purchase order
    Given a purchase order for "Microscopes" is pending
    When I mark it as "Received"
    Then the item stock should be updated accordingly
