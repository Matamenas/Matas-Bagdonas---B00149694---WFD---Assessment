Feature: Approve or Reject Requests
  As an Inventory Manager
  I want to review and decide on item requests
  So that only appropriate requests are fulfilled

  Scenario: Approve a pending request
    Given a request for "Microscopes" is pending
    And I am logged in as an Inventory Manager
    When I approve the request
    Then the request status should be "Approved"

  Scenario: Reject a request with note
    Given a request for "30 Projectors" is pending
    When I reject the request with note "Exceeds available stock"
    Then the request status should be "Rejected"
    And the teacher should see the note
