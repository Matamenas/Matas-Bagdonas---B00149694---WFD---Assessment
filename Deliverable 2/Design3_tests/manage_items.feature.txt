Feature: Manage Inventory Items
  As an Inventory Manager
  I want to add, edit, and delete items
  So that the inventory is always up to date

  Scenario: Add a new inventory item
    Given I am logged in as an Inventory Manager
    When I navigate to the "Add Item" page
    And I enter "Microscope" with description "Optical instrument", category "Lab Equipment", and quantity "10"
    And I submit the form
    Then I should see "Microscope" in the item list

  Scenario: Edit an existing item
    Given an item "Microscope" exists in the system
    And I am logged in as an Inventory Manager
    When I edit the item to change the quantity to "15"
    Then the updated quantity should be "15" in the item list

  Scenario: Delete an item
    Given an item "Old Projector" exists
    When I delete "Old Projector"
    Then "Old Projector" should no longer appear in the item list
